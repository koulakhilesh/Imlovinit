<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/koulakhilesh/imvoronoit/imlovinit_NB.ipynb)

Have you ever wondered how many MCD locations are in you city or how many museums are in your neighbourhood. In this project, taking Singapore as a base map, respective Voronoi plot are drawn for different chains. 

### Available Chain to choose from  : 
* MCD : List of MCD outlets in Singapore
* LIBRARY : List of Library location in Singapore
* MUSEUMS : List of Museums location in Singapore
* E_WASTE : List of E-waste recycling near you
* WIRELESS_HS : List of Wireless@SG hotspots in Singapore
* WASTE_TREATMENT : Location of Toxic Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal Facilities
* MONUMENTS : List of locations of monuments in Singapore
* HISTORIC_SITES : List of locations of Historic Sites in Singapore
* HERITAGE_TREES : List of locations of Heritage trees Sites in Singapore
* HAWKER_CENTRE : List of locations of Hawker Center in Singapore
* DSA : List of locations of Designated Smoking Areas (DSA)
* CFT : List of locations of Cash For Trash stations near you

Wikipedia Introduction:

<q>In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects. In the simplest case, these objects are just finitely many points in the plane (called seeds, sites, or generators). For each seed there is a corresponding region, called a Voronoi cell, consisting of all points of the plane closer to that seed than to any other. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is dual to its Delaunay triangulation.The Voronoi diagram is named after Georgy Voronoy, and is also called a Voronoi tessellation, a Voronoi decomposition, a Voronoi partition, or a Dirichlet tessellation (after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet). Voronoi cells are also known as Thiessen polygons. Voronoi diagrams have practical and theoretical applications in many fields, mainly in science and technology, but also in visual art.
